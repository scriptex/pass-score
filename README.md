# Pass Score

Get the score of your password as a number.

The number can be between 0 and the length of the provided array containing the conditions against which the password will be tested.

## Install

```sh
npm i pass-score
```

or

```sh
yarn add pass-score
```

or

just download this repository and link the files located in dist folder

or include it from unpkg.com

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/pass-score"></script>
```

## Usage

With default conditions:

```javascript
import passScore from 'pass-score';

// Returns a number between 0 and 4
const score = passScore('Your-passW0rd-Str1ng');
```

With custom conditions

```javascript
import passScore from 'pass-score';

// Returns a number between 0 and 2
const score = passScore('Your-passW0rd-Str1ng', [
  /[\W_,!?@*\(\)]/, // Special characters
  /^.{8}/ // At least 8 characters
]);
```

## Arguments

The function accepts two arguments:

1.  The first is the password string. It is required.
2.  The second is an array of regular expressions. It is optional. The default array is shown below.

## Conditions

The predefined array with conditions contains the following:

1.  `/\d/` - The password should contain at least on digit
2.  `/[A-Z]/`, - The password should contain at least one uppercase letter
3.  `/[\W_,!?@*\(\)]/` - The password should contain at least one special character
4.  `/^.{8}/` - The password should be at least 8 characters long

## Bonus

The `pass-score` module provides a native web component. In order to use it you can `import` it:

```javascript
import 'pass-score/component';
```

and then use it as shown in the [demo](https://github.com/scriptex/pass-score/tree/master/component/index.html).

The component accepts two attributes:
`styled`: a boolean attribute which injects an opinionated style in the component.
`patterns`: a comma separated list of regular expressions against which the password will be matched.
